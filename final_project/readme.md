# Readme
I included three notebooks that document (more or less) my process:
- `Data exploration.ipynb`: describes the initial data investigation, including finding outliers.
- `testbook.ipynb`: notebook used for testing functions and algorithms before putting them in `poi_id.py`.
- `develop.ipynb`: similar to `testbook.ipynb`, but focusses more on initial exploration of classification algorithms.

Furthermore, the file `report.md` is a markdown file that answers the questions related to this project.
